# Behold! 
My very first, basic, provisional web app project created only by me!
Ight, the code you're about to see is based on Spring boot, Spring Data, Spring Security, MySQL, HTML and CSS.
This program is mimicking an aplication that I use in my current job at the Copernicus Science Center.
Main functions are:
* (from the gallery worker site) send notification to specific department about the fault in exhibit on gallery (there are a few galleries in the building, which contain multiple exhibits),
* (from the IT/Workshop department worker site) catch the notification and let others know that you're going to deal with this fault and finally fix the issue.
* in addition, in this app (on both sites) you can find phone numbers or emails to the TroubleShooting department workers, which improves the intel flow in the company and makes it easier to cooperate,
* also created a few pure informational things like fault register

For now I don't have enough time to work on this project as much as I would like to, but as soon as I find few hours, I definitely will make some moves here.
